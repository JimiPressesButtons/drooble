# Drooble

A simple React + Redux implementation. 

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.


##Purpose: 

to learn me some redux. 

##Technologies: 

React, Redux, CSSGrid, Webpack, React Router v3. 

##Difficulties:

 I think the original problems I had with Redux was that I was use to seeing the logic alongside the elements it were modifying. And so because I like my workspaces to be an extension of my short-term memory, it was difficult to find any rhythm. 

##Reflections: 

Despite the size of the app, it still feels overwhelming trying to parse out how the app should work from a top down view. What I find so captivating about Redux once you get architecture laid out, the path becomes really clear and it then becomes just a matter of putting one foot infront of the other.

##Conclusion: 
This certainly is not the most complicated app, however, it was a great introduction to using Redux and actually seeing the power of CSSGrid.
